# RChain Bounty Program

In Aug 2017, the [RChain][] Cooperative president, [Greg Meredith][LGM],
dedicated funds to a distributed budget and reward system for working
together. We call the participants **RAMs**: RChain Active
Members. The rewards are intended to

  1. build a thriving open source developer community
  2. involve the creative community in telling the RChain story

We consider it fair if the value you provide towards our goal is
proportional to the value you receive. All decision making is
transparent and decentralised. Every RAM is free to...

  - Create new tasks (represented as
    [issues](https://github.com/rchain/Members/issues) in github) that
    they think will contribute towards achieving the goal.
  - Vote on budgets for task issues — this values how much solving
    that issue will contribute towards the goal.
  - Vote on what portion of the budget should be rewarded to each
    person that worked on executing the task issue.

Please briefly [introduce yourself](https://goo.gl/ffWXzD).

See
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/rchain/Members/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details of the process for voting etc.

Some important things that new RAMs should be aware of:

 - **Be a self-starter** :: because there is no boss, nobody is going
   to tell you what to do. Being a RAM is much more like being an
   _entrepreneur_ than it is like being a _employee_.
   - The [greeter][] issues can help you find someone to show you
     around initially.
 - **Think for yourself** :: RAMs work together like a swarm of
   insects does... but we need to avoid _herd-thinking_. We rely on
   independent thinking, and speaking up when you think we're going
   the wrong direction. Independent thought makes the coop stronger.
 - **Get things Done** :: We value the guy that steps up and
   _executes_. Having opinions is easy, but doing the work is hard.
 - **Morals matter** :: The crypto space is a wild-west landscape,
   where it's our own job to figure out our moral standards, and stick
   to them. We believe in transparency, openness, and fairness. But
   it’s ultimately up to our members to create and _guard_ those
   values.
 - **Be nice to each other** :: Most of our work happens online,
   distributed, remote. Be nice to each other, and easy to
   forgive. Even if you disagree, remember that we're all working
   towards the same goal.
