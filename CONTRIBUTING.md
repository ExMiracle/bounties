# RChain Distributed Budgeting and Rewards Bounty Program

In Aug 2017, the [RChain Cooperative](https://rchain.coop) president,
[Greg Meredith][lgm], dedicated funds to a distributed budget and
reward system for working together.

_[README][] is a more general overview; these are the specifics of the
process._

Ops (@lapin7, HJ) administers the system.
The process evolves with experience; stay tuned to
[bounty-contract](https://github.com/rchain/bounties/labels/bounty-contract)
issues.

[Membership in the RChain Cooperative](#becoming-a-member) is required
for later parts of the process, but to create an issue, all you need
is a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) so that you can create
or collaborate on work items represented by
[rchain/bounties github issues](https://github.com/rchain/bounties/issues/).

  2. [ ] request a Github collaborator role from @lapin7 in one of the comm channels, or mail [ops@rchain.coop](ops@rchain.coop), to get an invite
  3. [ ] then confirm the [collaboration invite](https://github.com/rchain/bounties/invitations) for the repository [rchain/bounties](https://github.com/rchain/bounties)
  4. [ ] become a [member](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!pendingmember/rchain/join) of rchain@googlegroups.com for getting access to our documents

## Decentralized Budget Allocation

Voting and collecting rewards requires [verified membership in the RChain Coop](#becoming-a-member).

RHOC are distributed monthly based on invoices.

**Budgets are allocated to work items by at least three Members. The average of three votes defines the budget.**

Use the [RChain Bounty Budget and Rewards](https://rewards.rchain.coop/) app at https://rewards.rchain.coop/ to vote. See [How To Use the Budget Rewards Web app][howto] for illustrated instructions.

[howto]: https://github.com/rchain/bounties/wiki/How-To-Use-the-Budget-Rewards-Web-App


## Decentralized Reward Allocation

- During the month each Member may vote on what portion of the budget is distributed to each collaborator as a reward for their participation. **The average of (at least three) votes sets the personal reward for each collaborator.**

Again, see [How To Use the Budget Rewards Web app][howto] for illustrated instructions.

## Centralized Payment process

- At the end of the month the situation will be frozen. No changes can be made anymore to either budgets or rewards. The payment process starts at the beginning of the month.
- The Member receives an email with a pre-filled invoice and also the needed data if the Member wants to make his/her own invoice. The collaborator stores a PDF version of the pre-filled invoice or their own invoice in his/her personal [Gdrive of Rchain](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5I9qM5f_1cfeUZoV01EYjdmOEE) Invoices.
- The Member then emails [invoices@rchain.coop](invoices@rchain.coop) with a link to the PDF invoice.
- The final payment decision is at the discretion of the Operations Manager and Coop Officers.

### Tax

- RChain Coop has to comply with the tax rules of the IRS. That means that at the end of the year RChain has to provide a list of payouts to contributors, with the amounts, through form 1099.
- If a contributor's rewards are more then $600 per year, then a [Fw9 tax form (For US citizens and residents)](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) has to be filled out [following the instructions here](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw9/index.html) and stored in the [personal folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5I9qM5f_1cfeUZoV01EYjdmOEE) Tax.
- For US aliens living outside of the USA, the [W-8BEN tax form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) has to be filled out [following the instructions here](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw8ben).

     NB: only lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are to be filled.
- As soon as the [Operation manager](ops@rchain.coop) is notified of the declaration, Ops will transfer RHOC to the provided ETH-addresses.

## Reporting
- Finally management reports will be generated and presented in Debriefings of RChain.

The first monthly cycle was Aug 2017. [Ops](ops@rchain.coop), (HJ or lapin7) presented this process Aug 30 in
[RChain Community Debrief 40 (24:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Li4g4qDF6M&t=1486s). An overview of the [budgets and rewards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxuxx8YN17KCIWcH1cUoGuSm2hAnIya2iAc6wxoaq1o/edit#gid=1751357908) is available.

## Becoming a Member

By joining the Cooperative you will participate in the lively conversation of the RChain community, vote on budgets and rewards, and submit invoices. Members can access the Discord server (no trolls or scammers) with direct access to the developers and governance decision making.

### Process

- [Sign up](https://member.rchain.coop/#/sign-up) for RChain membership, upload your id document, and pay the $20 membership fee.
  1. [ ] <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1913335/32598353-e489f158-c539-11e7-9656-4bcbb55718d2.png" alt="registration" width="200" />
- You will receive an invite link to the RChain Discord.
- Create a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) account if you don't have one.
  - On Discord, you can send a message to the @verify bot:
    ```/verify```
  - The bot responds by querying for the code that was emailed.
  - On success, a 'verifier' will contact you (depending on the time of day this might not be immediate).
  - After passing the verification, your role will be updated to Member.

### 4 Membership requirements

The RChain representative will check the following:
1. [Membership agreement](https://github.com/rchain/legaldocs/blob/master/Coop%20Membership%20Agreement.pdf) affirmed
2. Check the photo of govt issued ID
3. Verify payment of membership fee
4. Verify face on live video

### Promotion to member role

When the four membership requirements are met and recorded, a discord greeter will promote the user to role **member** and append a ':' to the member's Discord alias for proof of individuality.

Welcome to the cooperative!
